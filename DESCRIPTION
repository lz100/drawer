Description: drawR is an interactive image editing tool that can be added as part of the HTML in Shiny,
    R markdown or any type of HTML document. Often times, plots, photos are embedded
    in the web application/file. {drawR} can take a screenshot of these image-like, or 
    any part of the HTML document and send to a canvas-like workbench to allow users 
    immediately edit the screenshot(s) within the same document. Users can quickly 
    combine, compare different screenshots and maybe make a scientific figure.
